Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying computer science. I am fortunate to conduct research with [Professor Avideh Zakhor](http://www-video.eecs.berkeley.edu/~avz/?_ga=2.175130466.1927414544.1637551089-1897821002.1634176834), [Xiangyu Yue](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xyyue/) and [Professor Kurt Keutzer](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~keutzer/) in [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/index.html#header). I am broadly interested in teaching and conducting research about robotics and computer vision. I am especially enthusiastic about building vision models that generalize well, and exploring the possibility to leverage the power of robust perception to build autonomous system that can be beneficial to the society. Previously, I was fortunate to work with [Professor Koushil Sreenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/) in [Hybrid Robotics Lab](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/people/) on legged robotics.
